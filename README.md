# Update 16.08.2024: End of Life of this repository in the rwth-irt account.
## This repository will be archived due to administration reason. 
## It will be continuously maintained at https://github.com/hz658832/gnssFGO

# Update 25.07.2024
1. The docker is ready in the folder docker. More information, see README.md in the docker folder. 
2. A docker image can be pulled from 
```bash
docker pull haomingac/gnssfgo:latest
```
3. Using docker compose is recommended for visualization tools.
4. There are bring-up launches available: e.g., 
```bash
ros2 launch online_fgo aachen_lc_all.launch.py
```
5. Please download the dataset (see below) and change the bag path in the launch file.
   Or, you can set an env. variable
```bash
export BAG_PATH="path to bag"
export START_OFFSET="xx"
```
6. There is a mapviz configuration file in the launch folder that can be loaded.

### Video Demonstration (click the figure):
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/JhxJc1NFN7g/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JhxJc1NFN7g "GNSS-FGO Video Demonstration")

This is the official implementation of gnssFGO using the general framework onlineFGO based on GTSAM, in which a general time-centric factor graph optimization with continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression for online applications is implemented. 
The goal of this framework is to build a fundamental time-centric graph-optimization state estimator for online applications while doing research on:
1. multi-sensor fusion to improve the robustness of vehicle localization in harsh environments
 1. Fusing both tightly coupled and loosely coupled GNSS observations
 2. Fusing lidar odometries
 3. Fusing visual odometries
 4. Fusing uwb
 5. etc.
2. advanced inference for e.g., online sensor noise identification and hyper-parameter tuning (onging works)

## How to run
1. When using the datasets, launch irt_gnss_preprocess

  - For data in AC:
  ```
  ros2 launch irt_gnss_preprocessing gnss_preprocessor.launch.py
  ```
  - For the rest:
  ```
  ros2 launch irt_gnss_preprocessing deloco_preprecessor.launch.py 
  ```
2. Launch onlineFGO
  - For loosely coupled GNSS fusion AC:
  ```
  ros2 launch online_fgo aachen_lc.launch.py
  ```
  - For tightly coupled GNSS fusion AC:
  ```
  ros2 launch online_fgo aachen_tc.launch.py
  ```
3. Play ros bag
  ```
  ros2 bag play AC --clock --start-offset 60
  ```
4. (optional) Visualization in Mapviz (adapted from the official version)
  ```
  ros2 launch mapviz mapviz.launch.py
  ```
5. (optinal) If LIOIntegrator is used
  ```
  ros2 launch lio_sam fgorun.launch.py 
  ```
